        <div class="desc1">Boy Snow Bird is set in the 1950s and follows a young pale-skinned, fine-boned girl (named Boy) who runs away from an abusive father in New York as soon as she turns 18. She makes it as far as a small town in Connecticut and starts a new life. Boy falls in love with a man who has a beautiful, blue-eyed, pale-skinned daughter Snow. 
          Snow looks just like Boy. Boy soon has a child with her husband, and the little girl is born with dark skin and African-American features. We learn that Boy has been "passing" and the town, which had taken in beautiful Boy, turns on her. 
          Oyeyemi's book has a beautiful fairy tale quality to it and her sentences are rich, lush, beautiful. </div>

        <div class="desc1">You pick up this book thinking it's about the titular brothers.  And it is!  But it's also about their families and their small hometown.  After Jim and Bob Burgess leave their hometown in Maine for their comfortable lives in New York City, they watch the changes as Somali immigrants move to the town with a detached interest.  But it's the family and friends they left behind, as well as the immigrant community, that has to find a way to share the town.  
          After Jim and Bob's nephew rips apart the tenuous peace in the small community, the Burgess Boys are pulled back to their hometown to address the tensions that hide right below the surface in their hometown and in their families.</div>

        <div class="desc1">In his critically acclaimed history Freedom Summer, award- winning author Bruce Watson presents powerful testimony about a crucial episode in the American civil rights movement. 
          During the sweltering summer of 1964, more than seven hundred American college students descended upon segregated, reactionary Mississippi to register black voters and educate black children. 
          On the night of their arrival, the worst fears of a race-torn nation were realized when three young men disappeared, thought to have been murdered by the Ku Klux Klan. Taking readers into the heart of these remarkable months, Freedom Summer shines new light on a critical moment of nascent change in America.</div>

        <div class="desc1">In the American Revolution, Virginians were the most eloquent spokesmen for freedom and quality. 
          George Washington led the Americans in battle against British oppression. Thomas Jefferson led them in declaring independence. 
          Virginians drafted not only the Declaration but also the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; they were elected to the presidency of the United States under that Constitution for thirty-two of the first thirty-six years of its existence. 
          <!--They were all slaveholders. In the new preface Edmund S. Morgan writes: "Human relations among us still suffer from the former enslavement of a large portion of our predecessors. 
          The freedom of the free, the growth of freedom experienced in the American Revolution depended more than we like to admit on the enslavement of more than 20 percent of us at that time. 
          How republican freedom came to be supported, at least in large part, by its opposite, slavery, is the subject of this book. American Slavery, American Freedom is a study of the tragic contradiction at the core of America. 
          Morgan finds the keys to this central paradox, "the marriage of slavery and freedom," in the people and the politics of the state that was both the birthplace of the Revolution and the largest slaveholding state in the country.--></div>
